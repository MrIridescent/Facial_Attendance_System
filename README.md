## 📜 Manifesto of Capability
I do not merely write code; I architect digital realities. Since August 2004, I have been honing my craft across AI, Cybersecurity, Graphic Design, and Software Engineering. This project is a testament to that journey—a synthesis of computer vision and robust automation.

## 🚀 Overview: The 10x Evolution
This is not a demo. This is **Renaissance 2.0**, a production-ready, TURNKEY attendance system. We have evolved from simple Jupyter Notebooks into a modular, scalable Python framework designed for the modern era.

### Key Revolutionary Features
- **High-Performance Engine**: Multi-threaded face recognition with frame-skipping optimization.
- **Modern HUD Interface**: Real-time status overlays, high-DPI support, and elegant cornered face tracking.
- **Smart Attendance Logic**: Advanced cooldown management and session persistence to prevent log spam.
- **Turnkey Setup**: A self-healing setup wizard that handles complex dlib installations.
- **Cyber-Hardened**: A "Purple Team" approach to biometric data—absolute local privacy.
- **Renaissance Documentation**: Extensive research, manuals, and infographics included.

## 🛠️ Quick Start (The Noob-Friendly Way)
1. **Clone & Open Terminal** in the root directory.
2. **Run the Setup Wizard**:
   ```bash
   python setup_wizard.py
   ```
3. **Execute the System**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/`: Core logic (Engine, Utils, Data, Logs).
- `docs/`: Technical manuals, research, use cases, and infographics.
- `setup_wizard.py`: Your entry point to a zero-config experience.
- `RENAISSANCE_MANIFESTO.md`: The Digital Polymath's manifesto.

## 🔍 Audit & Verification
We have performed a forensic **Hype vs Reality** audit. Read our [Gap Analysis and Readiness Check](./docs/research/audit_report.md) to understand how this system performs in live environments.
